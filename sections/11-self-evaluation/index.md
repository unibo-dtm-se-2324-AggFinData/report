# Self-evaluation

## Mohammad Jamshidi

This project is my first experience building a full-stack web application on my own, without a good background in computer science and engineering field. While I had some basic understanding in web design (HTML/CSS), this project helped me to become knowledgeable about different topics in coding and  advanced reporting strucrure.

### Strengths & Challenges of the Project

I designed and implemented full system(user registration, stock search, and integration of Yahoo Finance and NewsAPI), managed both `artifact` (code) and `report` GitHub repositories completely by myself, wrote code part in organized, followed a clear way of folder structure, created detailed documentation for project, testing, CI/CD, ..., added responsiveness to UI( working on different devices), reported after designing due to working alone, and needed to understand complete pathway for project, manually tested user flows, learned how to use Git and GitHub in a professional way; branching, committing structure, `.gitignore`, restoring broken workflows.

I worked alone for project and I didnâ€™t have code reviews by groupmates or pair programming support to suggest improvements. I had some struggles in environment setup and version control errors, especially with ignored files like `__pycache__` and `.env`.  Some feature had problem in JS coding. Some are not working properly. Hopefully, They will be fixed for presentation day. Some advanced features ( user stock watchlists, saving history, or email verification) were left out because of timing and technical constraints.

### My Role in the Project

Since this was a solo project, I had all responsibilities( Planning feature set and project scope, Writing backend in Python. (GPT used for fixing errors.). Syling frontend. User authentication and database integration. Writing unit and integration tests. Manually validating functionality of project requirements. Troubleshooting environment issues ) for completeing the project.

### What I Learned

I learnt more than just how to write code, it taught me how to think like a developer. I learned how to:
Breaking complex problem into smaller steps, troubleshooting bugs systematically, using external libraries, building an end-to-end documented project.

> I did not have a technical background, but AggFin made a confidence for me to build real software in an independente way by myself. It was challenging, but rewarding and useful.
