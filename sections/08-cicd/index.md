# CI/CD

This part includes a description of the Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflow of project.

---

## What Is Automated?

Currently, CI/CD is **not fully implemented**, but setup is **ready for future automation**.

Workflow includes:

- **Code quality checks** ( test execution)
- **Automatic deployment** to test environment (and GitHub Pages for report)
- **Markdown validation** ( in report repository via GitHub Actions)

---

## Why Automate?

Automation is a critical step in modern software development because:

- Ensures **code quality** --> repeatable checks
- **Reduces manual errors** --> testing and deployment
- Enables **fast feedback**  --> each commit or pull request
- Helps maintain **project stability** --> working in teams

This app is simple and developed by a small team(one person), preparing for CI/CD aligns with industry practices and sets up the project for easier reuse.

## How CI/CD Is (or Can Be) Implemented

### GitHub Actions (for Report Site)

In **report repository**, Actions of GitHub are configured to automate deployment process.

- Static site generated by **Jekyll**, a tool converting Markdown content into navigable website.
- Every time commit pushed to **`main` branch**, workflow automatically builds site and publishes it to **GitHub Pages**.

automation is defined in the file:  
`.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`

### Branch Strategy for CI/CD

My **artifact repository** has a branching strategy with feature branches:

- The `main` branch is  **deployment-ready and stable branch**.
- Development work is done in branches like `error-pages-feature` and `login-register-pages`.
- After development and testing, changes merged in `main`, which then becomes release source.

This approach can be a good plan to help isolate experimental work, and having cleaner pull request, and keeps the `main` branch stable for CI/CD.

For **report repository**, a simpler setup is used:
- All updates pushed directly to `main`, for auto-trigger of GitHub Pages.

This balance between simple deployment and isolated development makes the project easier to manage while still CI/CD-friendly.

### GitHub Actions (Future for Codebase)

The **code repository** can support CI/CD with workflows such as:

- Run `pytest` on every request
- Auto-deploy using Docker, Heroku, or Render
